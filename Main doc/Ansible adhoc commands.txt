RROR! Syntax Error while loading YAML.
  found a tab character that violate intendation

The error appears to have been in '/root/myansible9.yml': line 25, column 1, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

    -  debug: var=print_output

^ here
There appears to be a tab character at the start of the line.

YAML does not use tabs for formatting. Tabs should be replaced with spaces.

For example:
    - name: update tooling
      vars:
        version: 1.2.3
#    ^--- there is a tab there.

Should be written as:
    - name: update tooling
      vars:
        version: 1.2.3
# ^--- all spaces here.
